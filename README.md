What is this?
=============

This project uses GTFS data from NJ Transit to display the instantaneous locations of its trains and 
buses at any given time.  It will respect holidays, weekends, and all that jazz.

How do I use it?
================

1. Install Ruby 1.9 and the Sqlite3 gem.
1. Sign up for a NJ Transit developer account from [their developer site](https://www.njtransit.com/mt/mt_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=MTDevLoginTo).  Download the rail and bus files they provide and unzip them into this directory.
1. Run `make`.
